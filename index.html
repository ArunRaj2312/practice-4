			<p>Xiaomi has come a long way in India since its first-ever phone launch back in 2014. Catering to the low and mid-range smartphone segments for the 
			past couple of years, the Chinese brand now offers top of the line and premium phones across its portfolio. Moreover, Xiaomi has been topping the 
			market share for several consecutive quarters making it one of the most successful smartphone brands ever in the country. This sure has made Mi a 
			household name whenever it comes to buying a new phone. That said, people and fans are always anticipating upcoming Xiaomi launches, and that’s 
			exactly what we’ll cover in this article. Here are the Xiaomi and Redmi phones launching in 2022 along with their expected specs, prices and release 
			dates.</p>

			<p>Poco was launched as a Xiaomi brand back in 2018, swiftly gaining popularity thanks to its first smartphone - the Poco F1 - which offered top 
			of the line specifications at an affordable price. Poco was separated into an independent brand by the Chinese electronics giant in 2020, before 
			the launch of its second phone. Poco's latest mobile launch is the M5. The mobile was launched in 5th September 2022. The phone comes with a 
			6.58-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 2400 pixels by 1080 pixels.</p>

			<p>For the longest time, Realme was packing its own suite of apps for its smartphone releases. However, thanks to a recent change, new Realme phones 
			have been coming with Google’s suite of apps. This includes apps such as the dialer, messages, and contacts. While Google’s app suite is quite powerful,
			it can be slightly frustrating in certain situations. For example, when you plan on recording a conversation over a call, the Google dialer app ensures
			that the other person is aware of the call recording through an announcement. While this might seem fair, it can hamper certain situations. If someone
			plans to record evidence for legal reasons, the call recording announcement could interfere with the idea. For this situation, we’re here to help. 
			This article will show you how to disable call recording announcement on Realme smartphones.</p>
